# Skade (Work in Progress) 

Im trying to build a Malware analysis engine in Go.  
The Goal is not compete with existing solutions but rather to learn about golang by building something with it.  
Im also trying to apply DDD principles to my best knowledges.

Done:
- [x] Find a structure for the project (hexagonal - DDD)
- [x] Building a simple Database schema


CurrentlyDoing:
- Building an API to handle file uploads and users
- Scanning uploaded files with yara rules


ToDo:
- Build a Frontend
- Implement an heuristics based approach of indentifying malware
