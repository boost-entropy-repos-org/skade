# Skade (Work in Progress) 

Im trying to build a Malware analysis engine in Go.  
The Goal is not compete with existing solutions but rather to learn about golang by building something with it.  
Im also trying to apply DDD principles to my best knowledges.

Done:
- [x] Find a structure for the project (hexagonal - DDD)
- [x] Build a simple http frontend to upload potenially malicious files

CurrentlyDoing:
- [ ] Build a PE file parser

ToDo:
- [ ] Everything else
